# **Coding portfolio**
This repositio contains my coding projects from university courses to my free time projects. It also contains some signal prosessing assingments such as small codes within other exercises.

## Nysse

This project was an assingment in course Programming 3, techniques. It was a pair project and our commit history is added to this repository to see what parts of the project was created by me. The project is a bigger project created with c++ in Qt Creator and the game idea is to play in Tampere and drive taxi around the city. More info in the project folder.

### What I learned
- Expand knowledge about working with a big project and multiple submodules and classes.
- To test own code with selfmade unit test, CLI and asserts during development
- To make documentation with doxygen and understand about Desing by contract

## Hanoi

This project was final assingment to course called "programming: basics". The programm is a GUI game called Tower of Hanoi created with c++ in Qt Creator. 

### What I learned
- To make GUI with c++ in Qt Creator
- More about dynamic memory management
- To work with multiple classes in one programm
